Work in Progress x86 Based Operating System

Operating System that is designed to feel like home - Haven

#READ ME
Hello, so I haven't worked on this in a while. I'm probally going to refactor the entire code to be worse (since I have no idea what I'm doing).
I'm not going to work on this project for some more time, but I WILL continue it at somepoint. Sometime before the end of the year.
Cheers!

# What's Planned?
- GUI
- Window Management
- Network Support
- Haven API for C (so its not just a kernel)
- Customization

# Downloads
The latest versions of Haven should be inside of the releases section.

# Build
Project has only been tested to build with Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
### Linux (Debian & Ubuntu)
1. Follow the OSDev Wiki ![tutorial](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler#Preparing_for_the_build) to build the required cross-compiler.
2. Download this repository and extract it.
3. Run './cc.sh'
<br>
Note that Qemu should open if you have it installed.

# Note
empty
<br>
The site that I am using to research this is the ![OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/).
<br>
I might move to x86_64 later.
