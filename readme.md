# What's Planned?

- [ ] Setup Basic Kernel
- [ ] Implement More Functions

- [ ] Entering GUI
<br>
...

# Note
I know that the stuff that I have planned is a lot for what I already did. As of writing this, I haven't even created the folder for the OS yet. I only built the compilers, so this is definitly not going to be quick at all.
<br>
The site that I am using to research this is the ![OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/).
<br>
I might move to x86_64 later.
