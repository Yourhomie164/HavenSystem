# Downloads
The latest versions of Haven should be inside of the releases section.

# Build
Project has only been tested to build with Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
### Linux (Debian & Ubuntu)
1. Follow the OSDev Wiki ![tutorial](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler#Preparing_for_the_build) to build the required cross-compiler.
2. Download this repository and extract it.
3. Run './cc.sh'
<br>
Note that Qemu should open if you have it installed.

# Note
I know that the stuff that I have planned is a lot for what I already did. As of writing this, I haven't even created the folder for the OS yet. I only built the compilers, so this is definitly not going to be quick at all.
<br>
The site that I am using to research this is the ![OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/).
<br>
I might move to x86_64 later.
